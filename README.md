# Smartphone_Skin_Erythema_Imaging

The primary goal of this project is to design a camera system that is optimized to see erythema in the skin. To this end, the imaging system should visualize erythema (oxyhemoglobin content) independent of melanin content (and ideally, independent of deoxyhemoglobin content as well). A secondary or alternative goal would be to produce an image in which the presence of each major skin chromophore (oxyhemoglobin, melanin, and to a lesser extent deoxyhemoglobin) with respect to the others can be accentuated.
